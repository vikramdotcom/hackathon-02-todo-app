## Prompt

# SP.CONSTITUTION
Project: Evolution of Todo – Spec-Driven Development

## Core Principles
1. This project MUST follow Spec-Driven Development strictly.
2. NO manual code writing is allowed at any stage.
3. All code MUST be generated by Claude Code using written specifications.
4. If output is incorrect, the SPEC must be refined — never the code.
5. Every feature must have:
   - Clear intent
   - Defined inputs & outputs
   - Explicit constraints
   - Acceptance criteria

## Architectural Vision
This project evolves across five phases:
Phase I: In-memory Python CLI application
Phase II: Full-stack Web Application
Phase III: AI-powered conversational Todo management
Phase IV: Local Kubernetes deployment
Phase V: Cloud-native distributed deployment

Decisions made in early phases MUST NOT block later phases.

## Data Model (Canonical Todo Schema)
This schema is fixed across all phases.

Todo:
- id: integer (unique, auto-increment)
- title: string (required)
- description: string (optional)
- completion metadata (TBD in phase specifications)

## Response snapshot

✅ Constitution ratified and documented at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

**Version created**: 1.0.0 (MINOR from empty baseline)
**Ratification date**: 2026-01-09

**Core Principles Established**:
1. Spec-Driven Development (SDD) – Non-Negotiable
2. Strict Data Model Compliance
3. Phase Isolation & Forward Compatibility
4. Feature Completeness (clear intent, inputs/outputs, constraints, acceptance criteria)
5. Code Generation & Validation

**Sections Added**:
- Architectural Vision (5-phase roadmap)
- Development Standards (testing, error handling, code quality)
- Governance (amendment procedure, versioning, PHRs, ADRs)

**Key Decisions**:
- Constitution is immutable until explicit amendment via `/sp.constitution`
- All five phases must preserve the canonical Todo schema
- Early phases do NOT constrain later phases
- PHRs and ADRs are mandatory governance artifacts
- PATCH/MINOR/MAJOR versioning for future amendments

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project governance established; all future development bound to SDD principles
- 🧪 Tests: Manual review confirms coverage of phases I–V, data model, and non-negotiable principles
- 📁 Files: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` created (1 file)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Phase I specification (CLI todo app), Feature specs, Implementation plans
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution balances strict SDD enforcement with extensibility across five phases; early decisions explicitly do not block later architectural choices (Kubernetes, cloud-native)

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none (initial ratification)
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual review PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): n/a
- Next experiment: Begin Phase I specification with feature-driven breakdown
